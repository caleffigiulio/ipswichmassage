So finally, the weather has turned, and it is a beautiful clear day and you have decided to go for a bike ride. Here are a few things to remember;

* Have you checked your bike â€“ or had it professionally set up so you donâ€™t have an over use injury?

* Do you know how to warm up and warm down?

* Do you know the benefits of massage to prevent injuries and improve performance?

* Are you aware which muscles you use to cycle?
(Quadriceps, Glutes, Calves, Hamstrings, Hip Flexors)

Did you know... Quadriceps do most of the work at the top of the stroke, glutes and calves then take over as you approach 6 oâ€™clock position, hamstrings then sweep the peddle back to 9 oâ€™clock position, hip flexors then help lift the pedal to the top for another go around.

Interested in knowing a little bit more about how to prevent injury before or after riding? Book in for a Sports Massage or with one of our Expert Remedial therapists! 

Happy cycling. We look forward to seeing you soon! ðŸš´
