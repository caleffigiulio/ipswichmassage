An oncology massage is a client-specific, customized massage session using traditional, established massage therapy techniques that have been adapted to account for your unique and changing needs during treatment for cancer or with a history of cancer treatment. A safe massage plan generally
revolves around the side effects (both short- and long-term) of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.

The changes that might be made to a massage that make it an **Oncology Massage** can fall under any number of categories, but typically they will be related to session length, pressure, positioning and areas of specific compromise or concern like mediports, bone metastases, compromised lymphatics (lymph nodes removed) or skin reactions to treatment.
