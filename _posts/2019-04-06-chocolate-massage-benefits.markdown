Scratch the “chocolate’s bad for you” negativity, we’re going all out in this indulgent Easter special, available for a limited time only! Tried and tested by Spa Gurus, celebrities, and now Ipswich! ![chocolate massage.png](/uploads/chocolate%20massage.png)
This Easter let the stress of school holidays and Easter family gatherings melt away with a customized Chocolate Massage, using rich cocoa and our signature oil blend to moisturise and firm skin, leaving you feeling and smelling good enough to eat! Forget the calories, just the sweet aroma, the soft and silky touch of our seasonal blend, and the delightful taste of Cadbury chocolate, a special treat from us to you… because we believe everything is okay in moderation-especially if it means time out for you! But how could chocolate be good for you?

**Firms Skin **
Chocolate has a high content of caffeine, an ingredient that speeds up circulation to temporarily firm skin, naturally rejuvenate and heal your skin, and packed full of antioxidants that give your skin a plumper, firmer feel, helping your cells to build collagen and elastin.

**Moisturizes **
The natural oils found in cocoa butter are combined with our signature massage oil, working into your skin to give it deep moisture- a power pack of moisturising agents. Chocolate Massage is particularly good for extremely dry skin, or on specific rough patches like knees, elbows or soles. The antioxidants found in chocolate massage oils also helps to lock in the moisture long after the massage is over.

**Improves health **
That’s something you never hear…. Chocolate… massage improves your health! Dark chocolate being rich in antioxidants can boost your cardiovascular system. Neurological director of Smell and taste treatments Doctor, DR Alan Hirsch found that chocolate positively affects your brain by causing feelings of euphoria. Even the smell of rich chocolate can give someone the mental and physical benefits normally enjoyed with consumption.

Sound like the perfect gift for a loved one to show your appreciation or celebrations over Easter? Our Chocolate Massage is available with 10 different skilled, chocolate loving masseurs, ready to get their hands a little dirty in order to have your skin glowing! The Chocolate Massage is available to book in stores or online right up until we return from our Easter celebrations on April 23rd, available as a Gift card valid for 3 years, even grab someone special and self-indulge in a luxurious Couples Chocolate Massage followed by an Herbal Spa bath.
How could you resist? We look forward to seeing you soon!
