On August 6, 2012 I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Colon Cancer. I was in shock and disbelief. I was not feeling myself for a long time. My husband died of cancer 14 years ago. All I could think of was what we went through and I thought “I can’t go through it again.” I thought about my family; especially my daughter. All we have is each other. I decided to fight. I went to the doctor and blood tests were done. They found out I was severely anemic, my hemoglobin was at a 5, and I was bleeding internally; which explained my lack of energy and motivation. Then they sent me to a Hematologist and he ordered more blood work, X-Rays, and an Ultrasound. Finally, he ordered a CAT Scan. It revealed a huge mass on the left side against my abdomen cavity. The cancer had perforated the colon and began to grow and you could see it on the doctor’s face that they were like, “Wow! What are we dealing with here?” Right away they told me I would have to have transfusions.
He decided to keep me in the hospital overnight. This all happened in one afternoon; I had to call my daughter to let her know I was being admitted. She was in tears and shock, we never saw it coming. I will never forget the look on her face and what she said to me, “We are going to fight it and we are going to beat it!” I had a Colonoscopy 2 days later and discovered it was Stage 4 Colon Cancer. It affected every part of my life. I was not myself at all. I was depressed. All I wanted to do or could do was sleep. I had been feeling this way for a very long time - 5 years. I had no desire to do anything. I started bleeding internally and that’s when they found the cancer. I just was so exhausted. I would wake and I was already tired. I was just tired, tired, tired.
My daughter spread the word for prayer while sharing with a friend (a patient of Dr. Kevin Huang’s). She told her, "you must take your mom to Dr. Huang". I know he can help her! Immediately after Colonoscopy my daughter called on her cell. Right after the Colonoscopy my daughter brought me here and it made me feel 100% better, and I actually got relieved when I got here. It was really peaceful and comforting. On August 6, 2012, I began treatments of acupuncture and herbal medicine. I really didn’t have any expectations. I just thought I would try it. I mean after all I was Stage 4. My daughters’ friend said you could trust him. What makes it better is that he’s a believer. He prayed with us and said I needed to start a diet change. I had acupuncture the same day. I could not believe the difference. You have to remember I was on my death bed and it felt good when I came here. I felt like a new person. I had so much energy and felt great. I also received 25 treatments of Chemotherapy and radiation together every day, while I was receiving acupuncture.![images.jfif](/uploads/images.jfif)
I had consultation for surgery on August 16th 2012. I was told it would be 6-8- hr surgery, I would need blood transfusions (due to my low hemoglobin), and more than likely I would have a Colostomy bag. A day prior to my surgery my hemoglobin was up to 9. The night before the surgery, the surgeon called and said she felt comfortable doing the surgery without transfusions. All my other labs were also normal and that was due to acupuncture. I wasn’t taking any medications or anything. I underwent a 10-hr surgery Splenectomy, liver biopsy, 2 ribs removed and my diaphragm re-arranged. As soon as I came out of anesthesia, my Surgeon was so excited and with tears in her eyes she told me, “Great news honey! No colostomy bags and no transfusions! You did wonderful!”
I was in the hospital 10 days. As soon as I was discharged my daughter brought me back for acupuncture. I was weak and frail, still had 4 drain tubes and could barely walk. I felt so at peace and energized physically and mentally every time we came here. My daughter continued to faithfully bring me to the treatments. December, I started my chemotherapy and radiation treatments. I truly believe the acupuncture help you cope with the chemotherapy and radiation. At the end of the treatments they did blood work and a CAT Scan and found that I was cancer free! It has been a year, cancer free. And I still continue with my acupuncture treatments. I am truly a miracle!
I just remember sitting in the waiting room waiting to receive my treatments of Chemotherapy and radiation and the looks on the people’s faces were sad and they complained of nausea and all the complications they were having and I just remember being so grateful to be coming here. I wouldn’t say I was a firm believer before coming here. I knew of natural medicine but I just never had the opportunity to try it. After the first treatment I was so energetic. I came every day for almost a week prior to my surgery. I literally left here jumping and skipping. There isn’t one day that I have come here and I leave feeling sad. I leave feeling uplifted. It helped me cope better mentally and emotionally.

In every way this recovery has affected life! I just feel so incredibly blessed and I could never say thank you enough. Words can’t say it. I mean he literally saved my life. After the first treatment I was ready to hop on out of here and I had energy! It was not just physical; it was mental because he gave me so much hope. I didn’t expect to get these results.
My friends and family were really amazed and in disbelief. They saw other patients go through what I went through without the treatments. There’s a little piece of Heaven here on Earth. There’s so many hurting people that don’t have to be hurting. It’s like the gospel, and some believe and some don’t. It most definitely works. Everything together is like the perfect combination. I would refer everybody that would come. I would just have to share with them what it did for me. It doesn’t take days, years or months. You immediately get the outcome! I’m the proof. The first day I left able to walk and run. I think I said it all. All I can do is share what acupuncture has done for me and pray that you’ll believe.
At my follow-up appointment, I was referred to my Oncologist. He suggested I have 25 Chemo \+ Radiation treatments simultaneously everyday as precaution. I thank God and Dr. Huang's faithful care. I slowly regained my strength and began 30 min walks in Oct. I started walking early November and I started to walk for 30 mins to 1 hr. (I now walk for hours and do Aqua Fitness regularly). I finished Chemo \+ Radiation in Feb 2013. Since then my follow-up appointments have been great. To this day one year later April, 2014, I AM CANCER FREE AND I AM A WALKING MIRACLE!
