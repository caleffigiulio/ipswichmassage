When it comes to setting New Year’s resolutions, many of us hope that each year we’ll be feeling healthier and happier than the year before, but who else finds it hard to stick to these plans or truly do something new for yourself?

Something to think about is making your **mental and physical health** a priority in a way that is good for your mind, body and SOUL. Without mental clarity and physically feeling well, you can't perform at 100% for others or for yourself. This is where Yoga, Pilates or Meditation can help!

Ipswich Massage & Herbal Spa have officially opened our new YOGA, PILATES & MEDITATION HALL on Waghorn St, Ipswich. We have classes available every day and everyone is welcome, whether you're a beginner or have been taking classes for years. The idea is to explore your limits, not strive for some pretzel-like perfection. It is a great way to get in tune with your body and your inner self.
