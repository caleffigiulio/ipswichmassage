Psoas - Pronounced SO-as
They affect your posture and help to stabilize your spine.

What You Need to Know About your Psoas
Structurally, your psoas muscles are the deepest muscles in your core.  They attach from your 12th thoracic vertebrae to your 5 lumbar vertebrae, through your pelvis and then finally attach to your femurs. In fact, they are the only muscles that connect your spine to your legs. That is why a tight or overstretched psoas muscle could be the cause of many or your aches and pains, including low back, pelvis & hips.
