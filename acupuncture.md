Due to the Covid 19 restrictions we are currently only seeing patients who desperately need pain relief.  We only have Dr Paul Gray Osteopath and Carolina (Physiotherapist) working.

Acupuncture involves the insertion of fine pins into specific acu-points to harmonise the flow of qi (vital energy) in the body. Other non-insertion techniques like moxibustion, cupping, or acupressure may be used alone or in conjunction with the acupuncture treatment.
