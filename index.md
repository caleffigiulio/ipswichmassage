### We are currently open and taking appointments, clients, and all bookings. 

As you are aware, there is a growing public health risk surrounding **COVID-19** (Coronavirus) and we are closely monitoring and following the most current information from local, state and federal guidelines. As a Medical and Wellness spa, we have always followed medical protocols for disinfection and disease prevention. Given the current situation, we have intensified our efforts for virus protection.

**Here are specific steps we’re following to ensure the health of our clients and staff;**
*Our treatment rooms, equipment and instructions have always been disinfected/sterilised between clients. We are now, additionally, disinfecting shared surfaces such as door knobs, bathroom fixtures, and our reception counter throughout the day.
* Sanitising supplies are available to clients and staff
* We have clear and frequent communication with our team to be aware of our policy updates and to follow instructions with care.
* For the time being, we’re discouraging hugs and handshakes, to keep us extra safe.

**For our clients;**
* Listen to your body. If you’re not feeling well, please stay home and seek medical attention. We’re waivering the cancellation fee for now, to ensure everyone stays safe and happy.
* If you’re experiencing anxiety around the situation, try taking a break from the media and remember we’re all in this together. Stress is our number one killer, so take a breath and try not to panic. Don't be afraid to reach out to loved ones, friends, a mental health specialist or even come for a massage to relax!

Wish you all well and hope to see you soon.
