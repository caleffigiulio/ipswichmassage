      <p>Philosophy at Ipswich Massage and Herbal Spa follows a healthy living philosophy that takes its inspiration from nature.</p>

      <p>We propose that tranquility need not to be found in any specific location but with the right tools, it can be discovered within oneself, by exploring body, mind and spirit.</p>

      <p>We embrace lifelong learning and development, our company never wanting to be everything to everybody, but instead offering only the very best to an exacting few.</p>

      <h2 class='ims-section-title'>History</h2>

      <p>Ipswich Massage Center opened its doors in September 2009 at 11 Lawrence Street, North Ipswich with just two therapists.
          </p><p>
        By early 2010 we had added a third person to the team and hired a part time receptionist.

        In 2010 we also joined the HICCAPS program which enabled us to provide health insurance refunds.
          </p><p>
        2011 saw us moving to a bigger 5 room premises at Limestone Street Ipswich. The team now consisted of 5 therapists and two part time receptionists.

        We began 7 day trading and launched our online booking system.
          </p><p>
        In November 2012 Sonja Glinster bought the buildings on the corner of Waghorn and Brisbane Street with the vision of creating a health conscious hot spot for Ipswich.

        Demolition work began straight away, however, it was a long six months before the team at Ipswich Massage could move in. Mayor Paul Pisasle opened the new shop on 1st July with over 30 people attending the grand opening.
