        Philosophy at Ipswich Massage and Herbal Spa follows a healthy living
                philosophy that takes its inspiration from nature.
      </p>

      <p>
        We propose that tranquility need not to be found in any specific
                location but with the right tools, it can be discovered within oneself,
                by exploring body, mind and spirit.
      </p>

      <p>
        We embrace lifelong learning and development, our company never wanting
                to be everything to everybody, but instead offering only the very best
                to an exacting few.

      <p>
        Ipswich Massage Center opened its doors in September 2009 at 11 Lawrence
                Street, North Ipswich with just two therapists.
      </p>
      <p>
        By early 2010 we had added a third person to the team and hired a part
                time receptionist. In 2010 we also joined the HICCAPS program which
                enabled us to provide health insurance refunds.
      </p>
      <p>
        2011 saw us moving to a bigger 5 room premises at Limestone Street
                Ipswich. The team now consisted of 5 therapists and two part time
                receptionists. We began 7 day trading and launched our online booking
                system.
      </p>
      <p>
        In November 2012 Sonja Glinster bought the buildings on the corner of
                Waghorn and Brisbane Street with the vision of creating a health
                conscious hot spot for Ipswich. Demolition work began straight away,
                however, it was a long six months before the team at Ipswich Massage
                could move in. Mayor Paul Pisasle opened the new shop on 1st July with
                over 30 people attending the grand opening.
