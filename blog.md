It is commonly said that our greatest asset is our health. Indeed, if we have all the assets or success in the world, but do not have health, then it is very difficult to enjoy. There has been some recent and proposed changed which will affect health-care therapies. We bring this information to our readership so that they are informed of changes in this area, either as interested persons in receiving Complementary Medicine or Complementary to Medicine therapies, or as practitioners, or both.

On October 13th 2017, Minister Hut announced that the private health insurance will no longer apply to certain natural therapies, as of 1st of April 2019. Remedial massage, however will stay on the list of therapies covered.

The Government, has assured us that it does not intend to revisit its policy, in order for that policy to become a law the proposed change needs to be endorsed by Parliament, through private health insurance legislation.

Following the potential passing of the legislation, the government will need to adjust the Rules of Private health insurance. There is no confirmation as to when this is to take place.

However, it is expected that stakeholders will be given the opportunity to voice their views of the changes. Therefore, the process of implementing the change in the private health insurance rebate list regarding natural therapies is going through the standard due diligence applicable to a proposed policy change. However, as stated above, there is no intention on the part of the Government to alter the change to the rebate list which Minister Hunt announced on the 13th of October 2017.

**The Importance of Choice**

With Health, comes *health-Care. *Health care is a fundamental aspect of Australian society. There are many aspects to health-care which the Australian public utilises on a daily basis, such as;

· Conventional Medicine: medical procedures, GP’s, hospital service and prescribed medications, which performs miracles on a daily basis addressing emergencies and symptoms.

· Complementary Medicine: which treats the body or persons holistically, treating lifestyle, diet and symptoms.

· Complimentary to Medicine: which works side by side with conventional medicine, providing support.

There are approximately 69 million complimentary medicine appointments with practitioners annually. Many Australians that are managing chronic disease utilise complementary medicine. The Australian public chooses between the various forms of health-care daily. It is a fundamental right of people to determine their own health-care.

**Conventional Medicine** 

![Conventional-Medicine-1024x683.jpg](/uploads/Conventional-Medicine-1024x683.jpg)Conventional medicine, commonly called western medicine, is a critical part of our health- care system. Conventional medicine is practised by registered medical practitioners and incorporates doctors, surgeons and medical specialists and associated hospital procedures and pharmaceuticals. Medical practitioners are registered under National Boards regulated by the overarching regulatory body, Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA).

**Complimentary Medicine**

Complimentary Medicine includes but is not limited to;

- Osteopathy

- Remedial Massage

- Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine

- Aromatherapy

- Chiropractic

- Counselling

- Naturopathy

- Western herbal medicine

- Nutrition

Practitioners of complementary medicine generally state that they offer and support a holistic service, considering lifestyle and diet, as well as symptoms. In 2007 a survey showed a sample pf 1067 adult, 18 years of age and older from across Australia were recruited on a random basis and interviewed about their use of complimentary and alternative medicine. The survey found that;

· Of those interviewed, in the 12-month period preceding the survey, 68.9% had used at least one of the 17 forms of CAM identified by the surveyors (the most popular forms of CAM);

· An estimated 69.2 million adult Australians had visited CAM practitioners in the preceding 12-month period, compared with an almost identical number of estimated visits to medical practitioners (69.3).

· The annual ‘out of pocket’ expenditure on CAM nationally was estimated as A$4.13 billion,

**What is the difference between Complementary and Alternative Medicine?**

Alternative Medicine practitioners and modalities operate *to the exclusion of* (or as an alternative to) Conventional Medicine. Practitioners of these modalities present that they offer an alternative that people can choose on a stand-alone basis. As an example of alternative medicine, a person may choose to treat disease using a diet, supplements or other treatment, instead of using conventional treatment by a medical doctor.

**Complementary to Medicine**

Complementary to Medicine means therapies that **work *alongside* and not instead of conventional medicine**, supporting the work that conventional medicine does. They deliberately work together with conventional medicine so that both are used for the benefit of the client.

Conventional Medicine is held in very high regard as effectively performing miracles on a daily basis that save people from often dire symptoms. Complementary to Medicine therapies can support Conventional Medicine’s work, and the body and person that receives it.
