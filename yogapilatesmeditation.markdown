### A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR TEACHER, MIKEALA
“I am so excited to meet you in our new space! 
I am a Yoga Teacher and Pilates instructor with additional training in Pre and Postnatal. I teach a hatha style yoga Focusing on mindfully connecting breath and movement. I am passionate about using yoga and meditation to create healthy minds.
I also have a love for teaching Post and Prenatal Yoga, to mindfully move the body through your pregnancy and beyond.
Pilates is such a wonderful complimentary practise to yoga. I found Pilates to build strength and better assist my yoga practise. See you on the mat very soon!”

### WHERE TO PARK
The studio entry is located on Waghorn Street (across from bob jane tmart), behind the massage centre. 
Free parking is available on Limestone and Darling streets - just a 5min walk. Waghorn street and Brisbane street is $1.40/hour as is Brisbane St.

### WHAT TO BRING
Yourself in movable clothing, a water bottle, your mat (mats available to use if you don’t have your own) and small towel for Pilates classes.
For child friendly classes with your little ones please bring their own blanket with any books/quiet toys where needed.

### PLEASE NOTE:
Shoes and devices are not permitted in the studio- please either leave your phone at home or in reception (our front door will be locked at the start of class when no one is at the reception desk, keeping your belonging safe) 
As the door is locked at the start of class please ensure you arrive 5-10 minutes early to class. This allows you time to find your spot, get settled in and take a breath before we begin. 
As you move from the reception to the studio please be mindful of unnecessary chatter, be respectful that others may have arrived early to class to step away from their day, preparing for their practise. If you’ve found friends and would like to chat please stay in reception until we begin.
