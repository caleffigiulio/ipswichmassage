### A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR TEACHER, MIKEALA

“I am so excited to meet you in our new space!
I am a Yoga Teacher and Pilates instructor with additional training in Pre and Postnatal. I teach a hatha style yoga Focusing on mindfully connecting breath and movement. I am passionate about using yoga and meditation to create healthy minds.
I also have a love for teaching Post and Prenatal Yoga, to mindfully move the body through your pregnancy and beyond.
Pilates is such a wonderful complimentary practise to yoga. I found Pilates to build strength and better assist my yoga practise. See you on the mat very soon!”
