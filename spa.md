**Hands with Feeling** (\$49.50) this **30 min** pamper is a quick and easy way to add a little well-deserved ‘me’ time into an otherwise busy schedule. Our pampering hand massage is both soothing and relaxing, and a great way to nourish sore or overworked joints. From repetitive strain from regular computer use to everyday wear and tear, our hands are often the last thing we think of when it comes to a pamper session, but often times a good and thorough kneading on our hands and wrists can really help to release tension and get you on the road to relaxation. Feel and see the difference with Environ skin care. Sugar Hand Scrub, Cuticle & Nail Care, Hand & Arm Massage treatment.
